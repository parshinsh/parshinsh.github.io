## Welcome!

Hi! I’m a third-year CS PhD student at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. [Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). I am also currently a research intern at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). My primary research topic is AI for symbolic generation (code, math, reasoning) and its potential for scientific discovery. I mostly focus on developing better algorithms for language models to handle symbolic reasoning and scientific discovery tasks, while studying their current limitations.
During the course of my PhD, I have also pursued summer AI/ML research internships at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/home) (2024) and [Gilead Sciences](https://www.gilead.com/) (2022). 
Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MS in Operations Research at Virginia Tech, and obtained my BS from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). 

If you're interested in my research, would like to discuss relevant topics, or explore potential collaborations, please feel free to get in touch :) - I am best reached by email at [parshinshojaee@vt.edu](mailto:parshinshojaee@vt.edu)

## A little more about me
When I'm not into AI research, I enjoy exploring all kinds of music and playing [Tar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXYy_bmlUpg) and [Setar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=enL-YQKihvg) instruments (think Persian guitars with their own unique twist).
