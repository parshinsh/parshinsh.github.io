## About Me

Hi! I’m a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. [Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). My research interests center on understanding how language models reason, adapt to new scenarios, and how these capabilities can be harnessed toward scientific and open-ended discovery. I mostly focus on developing better algorithms for language models to handle symbolic reasoning and scientific discovery tasks, while studying their current limitations.


During my PhD, I've been fortunate to have my work recognized through fellowships and awards, including the [Pratt Fellowship](https://ece.vt.edu/fellowships.html), and two papers nominated as **Oral presentation** at [ICML 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyQPiZJVWY) (top 1%) and [ICLR 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=m2nmp8P5in) (top 1.8%). My research has also been featured in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02616-5), [Women in AI Research Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD0_aHQvdR8&t=3s), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/06/26/why-the-ai-industry-has-a-reasoning-problem.html), [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44203562), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/corneliawalther/2025/06/09/intelligence-illusion-what-apples-ai-study-reveals-about-reasoning/), [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/apple-research-ai-reasoning-models-collapse-logic-puzzles), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/apple-artificial-intelligence-ai-study-collapse), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/meta-scale-ai-super-intelligence-lab.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThese%20are%20great%20tools%2C%E2%80%9D,lab?), etc. 
I was fortunate to work with brilliant researchers in the field whose mentorship and collaboration has shaped my research journey: [Chandan Reddy](https://creddy.net/) (VT), [Mehrdad Farajtabar](https://sites.google.com/view/mehrdad) (Apple), [Samy Bengio](https://bengio.abracadoudou.com/) (Apple), [Amir Barati Farimani](https://sites.google.com/view/barati) (CMU), [Iman Mirzadeh](https://imirzadeh.me/) (Apple), [Yunyao Li](https://yunyaoli.github.io/) (Adobe), [Shashank Gupta](https://shashankgupta.info/) (AI2), and [Khoa Doan](https://mail-research.com/) (VinUniversity).

Before starting my PhD, I completed my MS in Operations Research at Virginia Tech, and obtained my BS from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). 

If you're interested in my research on open-ended reasoning and discovery with LLMs, would like to discuss relevant topics, or explore potential collaborations, please feel free to get in touch :) - I am best reached by email at [parshinshojaee@vt.edu](mailto:parshinshojaee@vt.edu)

<!-- My research focus is on understanding how frontier language models reason, adapt to new scenarios, and how these capabilities can be harnessed toward scientific and open-ended discovery.  -->


<!-- My research focus is on cultural inclusivity and diversity within multimodal (vision-text) generation and understanding, but I also explore image and video generation more broadly. In my PhD, I'm revisiting the age old problem of translation, and exploring how it extends to multiple modalities (focus on visual). Checkout this github repo where I've been collecting resources for cultural NLP and please feel free to send a PR to add relevant material! -->



<!-- My primary research topic is AI for symbolic generation (code, math, reasoning) and its potential for scientific discovery.  -->

<!-- When I'm not coding or doing AI research, you'll find me playing Tar and Setar (think Persian guitars with their own unique twist) or exploring different music genres. -->


<!-- I am also currently a research intern at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), where I'm focused on reasoning with LLMs.  -->

## A little more about me
When I'm not into AI research, I enjoy exploring all kinds of music and playing [Tar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXYy_bmlUpg) and [Setar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=enL-YQKihvg) instruments (Persian guitars with their own unique twist). Recently, I'm also into hiking new trails, and trying to be good at gardening :D
